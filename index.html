    <section id="about-text">Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

            Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. You are only limited by your imagination. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.
            
            Anything you want to do you can do here. Let's get crazy. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.
